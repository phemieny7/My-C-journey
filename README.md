# My-C-journey
Here i will be glad to join up with teams of like minds developers so we can together learn C# programming together. 
I decide to take this part because i know learning might be tedious and boring, but because we are going to be learning it together,
I believe it will be fun. Remember, we are not learning this program to be a web developer, we are learning it to be a real virtual reality developers. So after we are done with this, we will be learning the amazing UNTY3D application together and we will all be joining up to develop virtual reality applications that can change the face of education in Nigeria. You are all welcome. Remember we are learning C# and after we are done, we will be moving on to unity 3D....... Let have fun...
